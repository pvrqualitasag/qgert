QGERT stands for Qualitas Genetic Evaluation Routine Tools. The goal of
QGERT is to post-process results of the routine genetic evaluation. The
main focus of the post-processing is on quality assurance and on results
checking.

## Installation

Because the package is only useful in the context of the genetic
evaluations done at [Qualitas AG](https://qualitasag.ch), the package
will not be released to CRAN. The development version can be installed
from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("pvrqualitasag/qgert")
```

## Example

Examples of basic use cases will follow here
