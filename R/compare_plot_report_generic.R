## -- Generic Comparison Plot Creator Function

#' @title Create Report With Plots From Two GE Periods
#'
#' @description
#' Based on a Rmarkdown Template (ps_templ) document all plots
#' in given GE directory (ps_gedir) are taken. For a given plot
#' in directory ps_gedir, a corresponding plot with the same
#' filename is searched in an archive directory (ps_archdir).
#' If such a plot is found, the two corresponding plots are
#' shown side-by-side in the generated Rmarkdown report.
#'
#' @param ps_gedir  directory with plots of current GE round
#' @param ps_archdir  archive directory with plots from previous GE
#' @param pstrgdir    target directory where plot files from archive are extracted, relative to ps_gedir
#' @param ps_templ  path to Rmarkdown template file
#' @param ps_report_text text that is included in the report before plotting
#' @param ps_rmd_report name of report source file
#' @param pb_debug flag indicating whether debug info is printed
#' @param plogger log4r logger object
#'
