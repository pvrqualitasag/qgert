## Features
The following features are available in package `qgert`

2. Create New Bash Script: new bash scripts can be created using the command: `<path-to-rlib>/qgert/bash/new_bash_script.sh -t <path-to-rlib>/qgert/templates/bash/bash_script_so.template` where on the ZWS-servers the value for `<path-to-rlib>` corresponds to `/home/zws/lib/R/library`.
3. Convert Bash Scripts To HTML: Specially formatted bash scripts can be converted into a static HTML-page. For more details, please have a look at the article on [Spinning Bash Scripts](https://pvrqualitasag.github.io/qgert/articles/spin_bash_script.html).
