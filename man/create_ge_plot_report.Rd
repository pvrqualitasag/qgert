\item{ps_archdir}{archive directory with plots from previous GE}

\item{ps_trgdir}{target directory where plot files from archive are extracted, relative to ps_gedir}

\item{ps_templ}{path to Rmarkdown template file}

\item{ps_report_text}{text that is included in the report before plotting}

\item{ps_rmd_report}{name of report source file}

\item{pb_keep_src}{should Rmd source be kept}

\item{pb_session_info}{should session_info be included}

\description{
Based on a Rmarkdown Template (ps_templ) document all plots
in given GE directory (ps_gedir) are taken. For a given plot
in directory ps_gedir, a corresponding plot with the same
filename is searched in an archive directory (ps_archdir).
If such a plot is found, the two corresponding plots are
shown side-by-side in the generated Rmarkdown report.
